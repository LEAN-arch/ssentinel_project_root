# sentinel_project_root/requirements.txt
# SME PLATINUM STANDARD (V2 - FINAL INTEGRATED VERSION)
# This definitive version includes all necessary dependencies for the refactored
# application, including the critical Pydantic libraries for configuration.

# --- Core Application Framework ---
streamlit==1.35.0

# --- Data Processing & Numerics ---
# Pinned to specific versions known to be stable.
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
pyarrow==16.1.0

# --- Configuration & Data Validation (CRITICAL) ---
# These were added during the refactoring and are required for the app to start.
pydantic>=2.7.0
pydantic-settings>=2.2.0

# --- Plotting & Visualization ---
# Pinned to specific versions for consistent output.
plotly==5.22.0

# --- Optional Utilities ---
# Uncomment if you use .env files for local development.
# python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# --- Notes for this requirements.txt ---
# 1. REPRODUCIBILITY: This file is essential for deploying the application, especially
#    on platforms like Streamlit Community Cloud. It ensures the environment has
#    all necessary packages.
#
# 2. GEOSPATIAL LIBRARIES: Heavy libraries like 'geopandas' and 'fiona' have been
#    intentionally removed. The application now uses Plotly Express's native
#    support for GeoJSON, which does not require these dependencies for the
-    #    current feature set.
#
# 3. MAINTENANCE: If you add a new library to the project (e.g., `requests` for
#    API calls), you MUST add it to this file for the deployment to succeed.
