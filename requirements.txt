# sentinel_project_root/requirements.txt
# Python package dependencies for Sentinel Health Co-Pilot

# Core Streamlit and Data Handling
streamlit==1.35.0
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4

# Plotting and Visualization
plotly==5.22.0
kaleido==0.2.1
pyarrow==16.1.0
packaging==24.0

# Geospatial - Lightweight (Only if specific non-GeoPandas geo operations are needed)
# If using GeoJSON features directly with Plotly Express, these might not be strictly necessary
# unless you perform transformations or complex geometry manipulations.
# shapely>=2.0.0,<2.1.0
# pyproj>=3.4.0,<3.7.0
# geojson>=3.0.0,<3.1.0

# NOTE: GeoPandas and its direct heavy dependencies like Fiona and RTree
# have been explicitly REMOVED as per refactoring requirements.

# Other potential utilities (uncomment and specify versions if used):
python-dotenv>=1.0.0    # For loading .env files if used for configuration
# requests>=2.28.0        # For making HTTP requests (e.g., to FHIR server or other APIs)
# openpyxl>=3.1.0         # If reading/writing Excel files is a feature

# --- Notes for this refactored requirements.txt ---
# 1. VERSIONS: Specific versions or compatible ranges are used. For production,
#    pinning exact versions (e.g., pandas==2.1.4) generated from a stable
#    `pip freeze` is strongly recommended for reproducibility.
#    The ranges provided here (e.g., >=1.30.0,<2.0.0) offer some flexibility
#    while trying to avoid major breaking changes.

# 2. GEOSPATIAL LIBRARIES:
#    - `geopandas` and `fiona` are REMOVED.
#    - `shapely`, `pyproj`, `geojson` are commented out. Only include them if your
#      refactored code directly uses their functionalities beyond what Plotly Express
#      handles with raw GeoJSON data. Plotly Express can directly consume GeoJSON
#      features for choropleth maps without needing these libraries explicitly in
#      many common use cases. If you are doing server-side geometry processing
#      (e.g., area calculations, projections), you might need `shapely` and `pyproj`.

# 3. SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES:
#    - Some Python packages might still require system-level C libraries.
#    - If `shapely` or `pyproj` are uncommented, ensure their system dependencies
#      (e.g., GEOS for Shapely, PROJ for Pyproj) are listed in `packages.txt`
#      or handled by your deployment environment.
#    - Consult individual package documentation if `pip install` fails.

# 4. REVIEW AND PRUNE:
#    - After refactoring, review this `requirements.txt` carefully.
#    - Remove any packages that are no longer used by the application to keep the environment lean.
#    - Add any new packages that were introduced during the refactoring.
